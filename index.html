       		I am a third year Ph.D. candidate at the <b>School of Information</b> at the <b>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</b>. My advisor is <a href="http://www.libbyh.com/">Libby Hemphill</a>. My research centers around using data science and statistics to analyze political science data, especially social media activity of politicians and survey datasets like the American National Election Studies, the National Asian American Survey, and the Collaborative Multi-Racial Post Election Survey. In my doctoral research, I study political preferences of Asian American communities, especially on racialized policy issues like affirmative action and police reform. Finally, I work on a wide range of computational social science projects, leveraging my skills in data science, statistics, natural language processing, and survey analysis.

          <br>
          I am organizing a <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>  on social media data collection and archiving, along with Marley Kalt and Libby Hemphill, at the International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2023.
          <br>

          At UMSI, I manage the archive of tweets of Indian and US politicians and influencers.      		
			Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at <b>Microsoft Research India</b> with <a href="http://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/">Joyojeet Pal</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/monojitc/">Monojit Choudhury</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kalikab/">Kalika Bali</a>. We studied the use of Twitter for political propaganda and election campaign strategies by politicians in India. I led the NivaDuck project to compile a dataset of Twitter handles of >36K Indian and >8K US politicians. Some of the projects I am working on are listed below.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
 		<p class="lead">My primary research and professional objective is to use quantitative research methods to study political interactions on digital media platforms. I use a diverse array of data sources - political tweets, news media stories, results from nationally representative surveys, among others. Primarily, my current work focuses on developing a conceptual model that represents major factors that influence attitudes of Asian Americans on racialized policy issues. I have relied on prior work to build this <a href="images/work/asian-attitudes.png">model</a> of factors that moderate and mediate the relationship between ethnic identity (national origins) and attitudes on racial policies, and I am now using datasets like the National Asian American Survey, the Collaborative Multi-Racial Post-Election Survey, and the Cooperative Election Study to test those relationships for significance. Finally, I plan to study the role social media discourse is playing in driving attitudes of Asian Americans on issues relating to (anti) racism in the United States, in conjunction with the factors already accounted for in the above model.

	    <ul>
	    <!-- <li><p><u>Extreme Speech in Indian politics.</u> Using the affordances theory, we analysed the differing consequneces of using 'extreme' speech for politicians and regualr citizens in India. We annotatted 469 hashtags used by a random sample of 997 Indian politicians as extreme and controversial, based on definitions from prior <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444817698776">literature</a>. We find that use of extreme hashtags gave a gain of upto 23 percent in retweets earned by politicians and led to no legal action. We juxtapose this with the prosecution and extra-judicial detention of common citizens that use similar speech against establishment figures using colonial era free-speech laws. This work was in collaboration with <a href="https://noopur.xyz/">Noopur Raval </a>, Han Zhang (UMich), <a href="https://soic.iupui.edu/people/sunandan-chakraborty/">Sunandan Chakraborty</a> (IUPUI) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mugdha-mohapatra-372548143/">Mugdha Mohapatra</a>.

I am working with <a href="https://ashwinrajadesingan.com">Ashwin Rajaesingan</a> at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan's School of Information</a>. 
    	</p></li> -->

    	
    	<!-- <li><p><u>Thematic groupings in election propaganda</u> - We are studying the thematic preferences deployed in Twitter campaigns by over 7400 politicians of India's two main parties, the BJP and the INC, by analysing the correlation, cooccurence and temporal variance of hashtags in their tweets. We This work is done jointly with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramaravindkm/"> Ramaravind Kommiya Mothilal</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/monojitc/">Monojit Choudhury</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kalikab/">Kalika Bali</a>. A graph plotting the partisanship of hashtags can be seen <a href = images/work/category_bands_log_scale_12_oct.png>here</a>. The partisnaship metrics are based on work by <a href = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19331681.2016.1214093>Hemphil et al.</a> 
    	</p></li> -->

    	<!-- <li><p><u>Misogyny and anti-#MeToo campaigns</u> - We study the use of misogynist and anti-#MeToo tropes by self-decalred Mens Rights Activists (MRAs) and their coverage by the mainstream press in India. This is a work with Azhagu Meena. -->

    	<!-- <li>
    		<p class="lead"><u>US Presidential Elections 2020</u> - We plan to conduct the first large scale study of US politicians' Twitter activity during a Presidential election campaign. We will expand upon the list of over 8000 US political Twitter handles published by the NivaDuck project and complement it with more local and state level politicians, and candidates running in House and Senate races, as well as Gubernatorial and State Legislature races.
          A visualization of the word embeddings of politicians' tweets can be found <a href="images/work/usa_by_parties_230321_0.html">here</a>. It shows how similar the tweets of politicians were during the 2020 campaign.

          <u>Race, Technology, and Racial Justice</u> - In this project, I have relied on prior work to build a conceptual model of atttiudes of Asian Americans toward racialized policies like affirmative action, the Black Lives Matter movement, and policing. I have analysed the ANES 2016 and 2020 surveys to understand racial divides between White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic Americans on such policies. We used multi-variate regressions to model the impact of racial identity, partisan affiliation, income, gender, education, generation, and anti-Black stereotypes on attitudes toward racialized policies and issues. These included affirmative action programs, preferential hiring and promotion of Black Americans, the police, the Black Lives Matter movement, racial justice protests, and urban unrests. We found that even after controlling for aforementioned factors, the White/Black, Asian/Black, and Hispanic/Black racial divides remain significant. This work is being submitted to Public Opinion Quarterly.

        <p class="lead">
          <u>Paywalls' Impact on Local News</u> - In this project, we are using data from proQuest to gauge the impact of paywall introduction on the content of local newspapers in the United States. Since the advent of digital media platforms, newspapers have been forced to move away from traditional subscription-based print formats to digital editions that aimed to leverage advertising revenues to pay for their day-to-day operations. 
          <!-- As collections from advertising fell well short of required finances, media organisations started introducing paywalls for subscription-based digital editions.  -->
          Did the change from free to paid digital content impact the editorial decisions surrounding published material? If so, which newspapers witnessed the largest shifts? What are the other factors that impact such shifts, if any? 

          I have used <a href="">tomotopy</a> LDA models to classify news articles into local/not-local, and soft/hard news. Moreover, I leveraged the <a href="">sentence-transformer</a> package by <a href="">huggingface</a> to estimate content diversity of news articles. For both of these metrics - topical categories of articles and content diversity - we evaluate temporal changes with respect to paywall introduction using a difference-in-difference approach. This work is mentored by Paramveer Dhillon and Libby Hemphill.

    	<li> <p class="lead"> <u>Public Figures Twitter Archive</u> - At MSR India, I led the project to collect a database of Twitter accounts of public figures relevant to Indian and US politics. We have built NivaDuck - Marathi word for selector - a machine learning classification pipeline that can find Twitter handles of politicians in a given country by leveraging the Twitter bio, tweet data, hashtags used and friend network of a seed set. Using this and other archives of political and celebrity twitter accounts, I have built and maintain the archive of tweets of over 60K Indian and 70K US Twitter handles at the University of Michigan, hosted at the Michigan Institute of Data Science (MIDAS). The tweets are updated regularly, and can be shared with researchers through collaborative research projects.
